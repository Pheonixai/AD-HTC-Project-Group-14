**AD-HTC Fuel-Enhanced Power Gas Cycle Simulator**
---
A thermodynamic simulation tool for modeling closed-loop waste-to-energy systems integrating Anaerobic Digestion (AD) and Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC).


**Overview**
----
The AD-HTC application models a synergistic waste-to-energy process that converts low-value organic biomass (e.g., cow dung) into dispatchable electricity, biogas, and bio-coal — while minimizing external energy demands.
The system's key innovation is thermal self-sufficiency: turbine exhaust heat (>400°C) is recycled to sustain the HTC reactor at 180°C, eliminating the need for external heating inputs.
This tool is designed for engineers, researchers, and policymakers who need a robust platform to simulate, analyze, and optimize multi-stage bioenergy recovery systems.

Key Features
---

Modular System Configuration — Independent modules for AD Setup, HTC Boiler Logic, and Power Analysis allow isolated variable adjustment across each subsystem.
Real-Time Thermodynamic Feedback — Instant calculation of pressure, temperature, and enthalpy across all system states for rapid prototyping and operational tuning.
T-H (Enthalpy-Temperature) Graphing — Visual steam cycle monitoring that enforces safe operating bounds within the 180°C HTC reactor, preventing overheating or underperformance.
